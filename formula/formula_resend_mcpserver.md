Yes, there are publicly available MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that you can integrate with Cursor to send emails. These servers utilize third-party email APIs and can be set up with minimal effort.

### ðŸ“§ Option 1: Resend MCP Server

The [Resend MCP Server](https://github.com/resend/mcp-send-email) allows you to send emails directly from Cursor using [Resend's API](https://resend.com/). This setup requires minimal configuration and is suitable for sending plain text and HTML emails.([GitHub][1])

#### ðŸ”§ Setup Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/resend/mcp-send-email.git
   cd mcp-send-email
   ```



2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```



3. **Configure in Cursor:**

   In your `.cursor/mcp.json` file, add the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "resend": {
         "type": "command",
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "/absolute/path/to/mcp-send-email/build/index.js",
           "--key=YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```



Replace `/absolute/path/to/mcp-send-email/build/index.js` with the actual path to the `index.js` file in the cloned repository. Replace `YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY` with your actual Resend API key.

4. **Obtain Resend API Key:**

   Sign up at [Resend](https://resend.com/) and obtain your API key from the dashboard.

5. **Verify Domain (Optional):**

   To send emails from your own domain, you may need to verify your domain within the Resend dashboard.

6. **Test Email Sending:**

   Within Cursor, you can now use the Resend MCP server to send emails. For example, create a file `email.md` with your email content, select it, and instruct Cursor to "send this as an email."

### ðŸ“§ Option 2: Mailtrap MCP Server

The [Mailtrap MCP Server](https://mailtrap.io/blog/vs-code-send-email/) is another option that allows sending emails using [Mailtrap's Email API](https://mailtrap.io/). This is particularly useful for testing and development purposes.([Mailtrap][2])

#### ðŸ”§ Setup Steps:

1. **Install the MCP Server:**

   ```bash
   npx -y mcp-mailtrap
   ```



2. **Configure in Cursor:**

   In your `.cursor/mcp.json` file, add the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mailtrap": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-mailtrap"],
         "env": {
           "MAILTRAP_API_TOKEN": "your_mailtrap_api_token",
           "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL": "your_sender@example.com"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```



Replace `your_mailtrap_api_token` with your actual Mailtrap API token and `your_sender@example.com` with your sender email address.

3. **Obtain Mailtrap API Token:**

   Sign up at [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) and obtain your API token from the dashboard.

4. **Test Email Sending:**

   Within Cursor, you can now use the Mailtrap MCP server to send emails. Compose your email content and instruct Cursor to send it using the configured MCP server.

### âœ… Summary

Both Resend and Mailtrap offer publicly accessible MCP servers that can be integrated with Cursor for email sending capabilities.

* **Resend MCP Server**: Suitable for production use, supports plain text and HTML emails, and allows domain verification.([GitHub][1])

* **Mailtrap MCP Server**: Ideal for testing and development, provides a safe environment to test email sending without spamming real inboxes.
