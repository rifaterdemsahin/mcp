# 📧 How to Use a Gmail-Based MCP Server & Create a File

## 1. 🔗 Connect to the MCP Server
- Make sure you have the MCP server's address and your Gmail credentials (App Password, not your regular password!).
- Use an MCP client library or tool (Python, Node.js, etc.) to connect.
- Example (Python pseudo-code):
  ```python
  from mcp_client import MCPClient

  client = MCPClient(
      server_url="https://your-mcp-server.com",
      username="your-gmail@gmail.com",
      password="your-app-password"
  )
  client.connect()
  ```

## 2. 🗂️ Authenticate with Gmail
- The server will use your Gmail credentials to authenticate you.
- Make sure you've enabled "App Passwords" in your Google Account settings.

## 3. 📄 Create a File on the Server
- Use the MCP client's file creation method.
- Example:
  ```python
  file_content = "Hello, MCP Server! 👋"
  client.create_file("welcome.txt", file_content)
  print("File created successfully! 🎉")
  ```

## 4. ✅ Confirm File Creation
- You can list files or fetch the file to confirm it was created:
  ```python
  files = client.list_files()
  print(files)  # Should include 'welcome.txt'
  ```

## 5. 🚀 Done!
- You've connected to the Gmail-based MCP server and created a file on it!  
- Now you can read, update, or delete files as needed.
