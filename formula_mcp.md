The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed by Anthropic to standardize how AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), interact with external data sources and tools. Introduced in November 2024, MCP aims to simplify and secure the integration of AI systems with various applications and datasets .([Wikipedia][1], [The Verge][2])

### üîß What is MCP?

MCP serves as a universal interface that allows AI models to access and utilize external information, execute functions, and handle contextual prompts. It enables developers to either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers .([Wikipedia][1])

### üîå Key Components

* **MCP Servers**: These are endpoints that expose data, tools, or services to AI models.
* **MCP Clients**: AI applications or agents that connect to MCP servers to fetch or manipulate data.
* **Protocol Specification**: Defines the communication rules, data formats, and error handling mechanisms between clients and servers.([ai.pydantic.dev][3], [Wikipedia][4])

### üåê Adoption and Applications

Since its release, MCP has been adopted by major AI providers, including OpenAI and Google DeepMind, as well as companies like Replit and Sourcegraph . It's used in various applications, such as:([Wikipedia][1])

* **Software Development**: Integrating coding assistants with real-time code context.
* **Enterprise Assistants**: Allowing AI to retrieve information from proprietary documents and systems.
* **Natural Language Data Access**: Connecting models with databases for plain-language information retrieval.([Wikipedia][1])

### üîí Security Considerations

While MCP offers significant advantages in AI integration, it also introduces security challenges. Researchers have identified potential risks, including prompt injection and unauthorized access to sensitive data . Efforts are ongoing to address these concerns and enhance the protocol's security features.([arXiv][5], [Wikipedia][1])
