[The room is dimly lit by the fireplace. Rain lashes the windows. The group sits in a circle, wrapped in blankets.]

MRS. HENDERSON: (smiling gently) Well, I suppose we're all in this together now. Anyone want some tea?

JASON: (shrugs) Sure. Thanks, Mrs. Henderson.

LILA: (wringing her hands) I just hope the power comes back soon. My son's afraid of the dark.

MR. KIM: (reassuringly) Sometimes, darkness helps us see what we've been missing. Like each other.

[They all fall silent, listening to the storm.]

JASON: (quietly) I never realized how quiet it gets without all the noise.

MRS. HENDERSON: (pouring tea) Sometimes, quiet is just what we need to hear our own hearts.

[They share a small, hopeful smile as the fire crackles.]
