To create a Google App Password, ensure that 2-Step Verification is enabled on your account. App Passwords are 16-digit codes that allow less secure apps or devices to access your Google Account.([support.google.com][1])

**Steps to Create an App Password:**

1. Go to your Google Account's App Passwords page: [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

2. Sign in to your Google Account if prompted.

3. Under "Select app," choose the app you're using, or select "Other (Custom name)" to enter a custom name.([admin-docs.zammad.org][2])

4. Under "Select device," choose the device you're using, or enter a custom name.

5. Click "Generate."([help.prowly.com][3])

6. A 16-digit App Password will appear. Use this password in place of your regular password for the app or device.([admin-docs.zammad.org][2], [support.microsoft.com][4])

**Important Notes:**

* App Passwords are only available if 2-Step Verification is enabled.([help.prowly.com][3])

* If you change your Google Account password, any existing App Passwords will be revoked, and you'll need to generate new ones.([support.google.com][1])

* App Passwords are intended for apps or devices that don't support 2-Step Verification. If the app supports "Sign in with Google," it's recommended to use that method instead.([support.microsoft.com][4], [support.google.com][1])
